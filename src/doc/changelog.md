## v1.0.4

- Fix some bugs that made the widget not working

## v1.0.3

- Use the FIWARE Lab's instance of CKAN by default
- Added support for IdM authentication using WireCloud's credentials
- Refactored user interface

  CKAN (based in the lucene syntax). Users can introduce those queries using an
  input box being the default behaviour searching by keyword (so users don't

  by the associated tag.
